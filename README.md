# Philly Mural Finder

## Description

The Philly Mural Finder is a mobile application which ads an interaction layer to the thousands of murals from the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program.

## Data

The base mural data comes from [http://www.muralfarm.org](http://www.muralfarm.org)

## Getting up and running locally

* Setup a local webserver ([MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html), [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html), etc.)
* Fork this repository into a folder that is accessible by your webserver (i.e. /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/)
* View the app in a webkit broswer by going to http://localhost/{path to muralapp}/public/index.html

## Roadmap

This project is new and liable to change quickly, but here is the vision for the first few iterations.

* A map loads in a mobile browser showing murals near them.
* A user can select a mural and find out more information on it (photo, description, etc.).
* A user can favorite a mural.
* A user can comment on a mural.
* A user can 'share' a mural. (e.g. facebook/twitter)
* Expand upon the types of art mapped
* Data collection capabilities 

** Research and understand needs of mural art community
** Research public wall spaces in Philadelphia

* Make separate native app versions of web app

* iPhone platform
* Android platform
* Use [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/) for conversion to native app
